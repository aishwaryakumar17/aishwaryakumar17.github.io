The data I chose to run regression on is world soybeans production and use. The data compared production with use. It was interesting to see an upward linear pattern in the data as the year progressed. The scatter points ended up being clumped to one area for a particular period of time (usually a couple years) before usage increases. 

I used the custom option under charts to run a linear line across the scatter point. It was a straight upward line. The r^2 value was 0.8 for the linear line. I also tried to run an exponential line through the scatter point and found out since the values were clumped together, the exponential line was a little bit more accurate – it had a value of 0.81. 

At a certain point in the near future, the usage of soybeans across the world will tip over to the point where production will not be able to sustain the given usage. 

This data is great for predicting the future – if I was working on a story about soybeans production, I could use this data to find out how long it would take for the produce to not be sufficient with regards to the usage.
