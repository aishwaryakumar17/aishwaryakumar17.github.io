## How many people rode the CTA stop closest to your house

CTA rideship in 2015: 

The dataset I chose to analyze is the CTA rideship data. The datasheet consisted of information like station ID, Station name, average weekly rides, average Saturday rides and average Sunday rides based on each station in Chicago. This dataset is based on the station people got into the train. 

From basic restructuring, I understood that for most of the months in 2015, Lake/State and Clark/State had the most number of riders. I segregated the data according to months and on simple addition, found out that every month, the rideship reduces by half during the weekends (Sunday especially) when compared to weekdays. The sum total of average weekly rides was the most in Monroe and State at 690,000 odd riders. The second most ridden L station is Grand and State with an average of 680,000 odd riders.

I also calculated the mean and median average weekly, Saturday, Sunday and monthly rides. It is not surprising that the mean is always higher than the median, sometimes as many as 1000s of riders because of the outliers (0 and 11,000). The median of the average weekly rides came up to 3,255 – this is interesting considering there are thousands of passengers getting on at all the main red, brown and green line stations like Lake, State, Grand, Chicago, Belmont, Addison etc. The mean for Saturdays and Sundays is at 2,500 odd while the median is at a little over 2,000. The mean for the average monthly rides is over 115,000 while the median is over 83,000. In every case, it makes sense to consider the median and not the mean, just because the outliers are crazy (like in the case of 0). What was surprising: a few stations like Dempster/Wabash and Madison/Wabash had zero average visitors. I don't know what that means, it doesn't make sense.

I lived right off of the Addison red line station in Wrigleyville and with more than 50 Cubs games happening at the venue every year, I see thousands of passengers get on after watching the match. I am really curious to know how the passenger numbers from stops close to the baseball, basketball, hockey stadiums affect the average overall. Are there more games in the stadiums during the weekend than there are during weekdays? Does it double or triple the average passenger number in that stop? This will be an interesting angle to write about. 

Once they release the information for 2016, I am very interested in comparing the 2016 data to 2015. Did any crime-related incident stop people from going to a particular CTA stop? (woman stabbed to death in 47th red line stop). Did renovations make people switch to another stop? Have people started using the buses more? 

This is not so important but I was also baffled by the number of CTA stops there are in Chicago – 1729? That is pretty incredible for one city.
